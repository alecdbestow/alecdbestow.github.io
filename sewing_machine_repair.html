        <h2>Removing the Gear</h2>
         <p>The gear was overmoulded onto this aluminium part attached to the main arm shaft.</p>
        <img src="media/sewing_machine_repair/broken_gear_location.jpg" alt="location of broken gear">
        <p>In order to develop a design, and for the eventual repair, a closer look at the aluminium part is needed. However, the grub screw holding the head cam onto the arm shaft is stuck (presumed loctite).</p> 
        <img src="media/sewing_machine_repair/grub_screw.jpg" alt="grub screw">
        <p>Attempts at heating the grub screw to break the loctite have failed. The first attempt was to use a soldering iron. The second attempt was to apply a red hot screwdriver to it. As of today, the grub screw is still stuck.</p>
