        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>The plastic indexing gear in the sewing machine arm, used to sewing buttons and zig-zags, has broken. The zig-zag function is an essential function on any sewing machine.</p>

        <h2>Removing the Gear</h2>
        <p>The gear was overmoulded onto this aluminium part attached to the main arm shaft.</p>

        </figure> 
        <p>To replace the gear, this aluminium part will need to be removed from the shaft so a replacement can be fitted. For this, the shaft will have to be removed, which will require a full disassembly of the sewing machine.</p>
        <p>This turned out to be much more difficult than expected. Due to the age of the machine, there were many sticking points when it came to disassembly. The first of which was the grub screw for the head cam, which required an impact gun to remove.</p>

        <p>One of the more difficult sticking points was removing the balance wheel bushing. It was not entirely obvious as to how it was attached. After several hours of trawling through several older sewing machine repair manuals, the following image was found which seemed to indicate that it was attached with a pin. </p>
        <p> Once this was discovered, a display of brute force with a nail punch and hammer commenced until a mangled pin fell out. Given the tooling limitations in the apartment this was the only option, but probably contributed to more issues down the track.</p>

        <p>Once the balance wheel bushing stop was removed, the next step was to remove the two steel bushings on either end of the shaft. The only way to do this required disassembly of the whole head mechanism to allow access to both ends of the shaft.</p>

        <p>It turned out that both bushings were well and truly stuck. Not only that, the handwheel end of the shaft didn't fit through the end of the bushing.</p>
